Project Context:
You are working on the **Karisma 5S Audit** application hosted on **Replit** using React and Replit DB. The app is live and stable. Most modules are operational and several enhancement stages have already been implemented.

üß† MCP Directive:
Use autonomous reasoning and sequential task execution. You are expected to **validate all dependent functions**, ensure **no existing functionality is broken**, and thoroughly test your output before proposing any final changes.

üéØ Objective: Fix Superadmin Roles & Implement Stage 9 Notification Rules

1. ‚úÖ **Fix Superadmin Role Assignment**
   - Ensure that **azril**, **calvin**, and **shukri** have persistent `superadmin` privileges.
   - DO NOT modify other users or their data.
   - Validate the admin panel reflects superadmin access for these users only.
   - Test role functionality using the current user login state logic.

2. üö® **Implement Notification Rules (Stage 9)**
   - Add logic to trigger **email alerts** for:
     - Overdue action items
     - Failed audits
   - Build admin-accessible **Notification Settings UI** to:
     - Enable/disable specific alerts
     - Select delivery method (email for now, Slack/webhook placeholders allowed)
   - If email config is not yet active, **mock the email delivery function** with console logs but structure code cleanly for future SMTP config.
   - Store preferences in Replit DB (or supabase if activated).
   - Ensure language support for this new module.

---

üõ°Ô∏è Guardrails (MUST FOLLOW):
- DO NOT remove, rename, or refactor **any existing working component**.
- Validate after each file change that no dependent features break.
- Run regression tests (if defined) or simulate manual test flows for:
  - Login, profile save, language change, zone/team views
  - User list, report export, and audit record creation
- DO NOT delete any existing teams or users unless explicitly instructed.

---

üí¨ Notes:
- Use conservative logic. No experimental APIs unless wrapped in fallback conditions.
- Your edits must **integrate**, not overwrite. Assume this app is in active use by real users.

---

Proceed carefully. All functionality must remain intact after changes.
