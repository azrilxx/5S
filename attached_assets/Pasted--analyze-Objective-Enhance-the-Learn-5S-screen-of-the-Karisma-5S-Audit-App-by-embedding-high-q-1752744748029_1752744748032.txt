## Objective
Enhance the `Learn 5S` screen of the Karisma 5S Audit App by embedding high-quality educational content into each of the five 5S learning modules. Use your autonomous agent capabilities to research and integrate supporting material **without breaking or modifying any existing working logic or components**.

---

## Constraints
- ✅ Do not change or remove any existing UI code, props, logic, or behavior.
- ✅ Do not break the existing layout or Tailwind styling.
- ✅ All enhancements must be **fully backward compatible**.
- ✅ All enhancements must be **optional** and fail-safe (i.e., fallback if no content found).

---

## Tasks

### 1. Research Phase
For each of the five 5S categories — Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke — perform a real-time web search and:

- Identify a **clear, accurate, and up-to-date** educational video (YouTube or other embed-safe platforms).
- Confirm that the video is embeddable and suitable for workplace learning.
- Summarize key bullet points from reputable sources about each concept (Seiri to Shitsuke).

---

### 2. Embed Phase
For each 5S card component:

- Add an **optional embedded YouTube video** inside the card, styled responsively.
- Below the title and description, add a small embedded video area (`<iframe>` with fallback).
- Include a bullet list of 2–3 takeaway points under each module, styled with subtle text classes (`text-sm text-muted`).

---

### 3. Resilience Phase
Ensure the following:

- If the video link or metadata is not available, fallback gracefully with:
  - Existing static description text.
  - A placeholder text such as `“Video not available – check your internet connection or contact admin.”`
- Do not affect the module state, review status, or buttons.

---

### 4. QA Phase
Perform the following before finalizing:

- Run an internal check that **none of the following are affected**:
  - Auth logic
  - Admin roles
  - Routes
  - Layout wrapping
  - Completion toggles
  - Tailwind classes and spacing
- Confirm that `azril` and `shukri` still retain admin functionality and dashboard access.

---

## Output

- Update only the `Learn5S.tsx` or equivalent component
- Return a complete, working code snippet ready to be copy-pasted and redeployed
- Include a comment at the top: `// Claude-enhanced with 5S multimedia embeds (safe mode enabled)`
