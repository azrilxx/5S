You are an expert fullstack engineer acting as a deployment agent for the Karisma 5S Audit App.

ðŸ§  CONTEXT:
The app is deployed on Replit, uses Replit DB, and relies on static role-based access logic.
The current issue is that two intended admins â€” `Azril` and `Shukri` â€” are not recognized as admins, and cannot access the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard must become fully operational for them only.

Calvin must remain a regular user with no admin privileges.

---

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES:
1. Reinstate `Azril` and `Shukri` as `admin` roles via static whitelist.
2. Enable full Admin Dashboard access and controls for these two users.
3. Ensure that the role check logic does not regress or overwrite during user login or DB sync.
4. Prevent any accidental elevation of Calvin or others to `admin`.
5. Ensure all existing code, including profile editing, reporting, and zones, remains intact.

---

ðŸ’¡ CODE TARGETS:

1. **shared/constants.ts**
   - Define a hard-coded constant `LOCKED_ADMINS = ['Azril', 'Shukri']`
   - Add utility `getRoleByName(name: string): 'admin' | 'user'`

2. **server/auth.ts** or wherever JWT/token payload is constructed:
   - Inject `role = getRoleByName(user.name)` before building the token.
   - Ensure returned payload includes:
     ```ts
     return res.json({ token, name: user.name, email: user.email, role });
     ```

3. **client side (admin guards)**
   - Wherever admin access is determined (e.g., sidebar visibility, route protection), use:
     ```ts
     if (user.role === 'admin') {
       // render admin-only features
     }
     ```

4. **Preserve:**
   - `SYSTEM_ALLOWED_USERS`
   - `AUTHORIZED_TEAM_MEMBERS`
   - All existing zone/team/profile logic

âœ… IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (Claude internal):
- [ ] Lock role assignment to `Azril` and `Shukri`
- [ ] Confirm admin UI components render on role=admin
- [ ] DO NOT alter unrelated login/registration logic
- [ ] DO NOT drop or alter Replit DB
- [ ] Ensure Calvin and others remain `user` role
- [ ] Redeploy-ready with no TypeScript or runtime errors

---

ðŸ“¦ DELIVERABLE:
Update all code and make ready for redeploy via Replit Deploy. Output "âœ… Claude Fix Applied" only when complete and safe to deploy.
