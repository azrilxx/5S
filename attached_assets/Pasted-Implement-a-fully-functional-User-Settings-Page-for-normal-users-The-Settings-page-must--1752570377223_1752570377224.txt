Implement a fully functional **User Settings Page** for normal users.

The Settings page must:
- Be accessible to logged-in non-admin users only
- Be built with the existing design system (TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui)
- Be stored and fetched from Replit DB using key pattern: `user:<username>:settings`

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

### 1. 🔐 Account Info
- Display name and username (read-only)
- Allow password update:
  - Old password verification required
  - New password confirmation

### 2. 🔔 Notifications
- Enable/disable email alerts for:
  - Assigned actions
  - Upcoming audits
  - Overdue items

### 3. 🌐 Language Preferences
- Language dropdown (default: English)
  - Options: English, Malay, Mandarin
- UI labels should respect this setting (prepare basic i18n structure)

### 4. 🎨 Theme Preferences (Optional)
- Add toggle for Light/Dark mode using local storage or app theme context

### 5. 📆 Audit History
- Show logged-in user’s completed audits (summary view)
- Button to download selected audit as PDF

## 🚫 Restrictions
- Do NOT expose admin-only functions
- Do NOT allow direct access to system zones, other users, or configuration
- Keep all user settings self-contained per user keyspace

## 💾 Data Model (Replit DB)

Example key: `user:azril:settings`
```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "notifications": {
    "assignedActions": true,
    "upcomingAudits": true,
    "overdueItems": true
  },
  "theme": "dark"
}

📚 i18n Stub Data (Start with static dictionary)

export const translations = {
  en: { settings: "Settings", language: "Language", ... },
  ms: { settings: "Tetapan", language: "Bahasa", ... },
  zh: { settings: "设定", language: "语言", ... }
}

🔄 Tasks

    Create Settings.tsx page/component with Tailwind + shadcn/ui

    Read/write settings from Replit DB

    Update Navbar to link to Settings page (for normal users only)

    Implement i18n context or local translation function

    Hook audit history to display audit keys that belong to current user

    Ensure app does not crash if settings key not yet created

🧪 Validation

    Log in as normal user → Visit Settings

    Change language → UI reflects selected language

    Toggle email notifications → Persist and recall from DB

    Update password → Login requires new password

    View past audits → Downloadable as PDF

    No access to admin functions

All changes must retain full app functionality and not affect admin dashboard or Replit deployment.
